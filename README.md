# poniescript-vscode

This is a VSCode extension that is meant to provide support for the PonieScript
language.

The language server is currently a work-in-progress. It is currently part of
the main PonieScript repo.

You should have a `poniescript-lsp` executable somewhere for running the VSCode
extension; You can use the `poniescript.languageServer.path` option in settings.json
to specify a particular path to it, and the `poniescript.languageServer.args` option
to specify command-line args (which will likely be in flux for the time being).
